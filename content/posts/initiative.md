### Why hello there

I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of this blog is but I guess I now have *a place* to dump my thoughts?

### Title

One of the things you tend to understand as you work in team structures is that doing the bare minimum is not particularly difficult (assuming you're diligent of course). The thing is though, when you are given a responsibilty, its because whoever you're supposed to report to cannot handle so many things at once; hence the delegation of work.

But what that delegation of work fundamentally means is that they cannot be making the **decisions** about the nitty gritty of whatever it is you're supposed to be doing. So when you go ask your superior what the best way of implementing something would be, you're effectively asking them to do *your* job.

I know it sounds simple but understanding that your job is to abstract away the micro decisions that need to be made is key to doing your job right.

However, what this also means is that you are now responsible for the decisions that you made, which I think is what leads a lot of people to get a stamp of approval from a higher authority before they commit to doing things a certain way (The classic "Look I know adding React as a dependency for *just* this one page was probably a bad idea but *they* signed off on it so it's not my fault!" situation)

Anyway the point is, take {{< fontfamily >}}Initiative{{< /fontfamily >}} and go make some bad decisions!
